# DVS frame reconstruction with manifold regularization

Quick-start: See example.py.

A pure python offline implementation of the code from this repo:

https://github.com/VLOGroup/dvs-reconstruction

From the publication: Reinbacher, Graber and Pock, "Real-Time Intensity-Image Reconstruction for Event Cameras Using Manifold Regularisation", BMVC, 2016.

The authors suggest to cite the following publication:

  @inproceedings{reinbacher_bmvc2016,
    author = {Christian Reinbacher and Gottfried Graber and Thomas Pock},
    title = {{Real-Time Intensity-Image Reconstruction for Event Cameras Using Manifold Regularisation}},
    booktitle = {2016 British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC)},
    year = {2016},
  }

The original repo ships with example data, which can be found here:

https://github.com/VLOGroup/dvs-reconstruction/blob/master/data/sample_data.tar.bz2

Alternatively you can import any DVS data using 'bimvee' library.

Dependencies:

* numpy
* bimvee (https://pypi.org/project/bimvee/)
